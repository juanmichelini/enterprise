This repository contains the code for OpenHands Enterprise, an automated AI software engineer. It has a Python backend
and a React frontend (in the `frontend` directory). The backend is the OpenHands app server (in the `openhands`
directory) plus the SaaS/enterprise modules that extend it, which sit beside it at the repository root:
`server/`, `storage/`, `integrations/`, `sync/`, `analytics/`, `utils/`, `migrations/` and the entrypoints
`saas_server.py`, `run_maintenance_tasks.py`, `run_budget_maintenance.py`, `run_budget_preflight.py`. This is the same layout the Docker
image has in `/app`. Python dependencies are managed with uv (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`).

## General Setup:
To set up the entire repo, including frontend and backend, run `make build`.
You don't need to do this unless the user asks you to, or if you're trying to run the entire application.

## Running OpenHands with OpenHands:
To run the full application to debug issues:
```bash
export INSTALL_DOCKER=0
export RUNTIME=local
make build && make run FRONTEND_PORT=12000 FRONTEND_HOST=0.0.0.0 BACKEND_HOST=0.0.0.0 &> /tmp/openhands-log.txt &
```

Local run troubleshooting notes:
- If the backend fails with `nc: command not found`, install `netcat-openbsd`.
- If local runtime startup fails with `duplicate session: test-session`, clear the stale tmux session on the default socket: `tmux -S /tmp/tmux-$(id -u)/default kill-session -t test-session`.
- Local runtime browser startup expects Playwright browsers under `~/.cache/playwright`; if needed run `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/.cache/playwright uv run playwright install chromium`.
- In this sandbox environment, an inherited `SESSION_API_KEY` can make `/api/v1/settings` return 401 in the browser. Unset it before `make run` when you want to use the local web UI directly.
- In this sandbox, `frontend`'s `npm run dev:mock` / `dev:mock:saas` can start but still be awkward to browse through the work-host proxy. For PR QA screenshots, a reliable fallback is to `npm run build` with the desired `VITE_MOCK_*` env, then serve `build/` with a tiny custom HTTP server that returns the minimal mock JSON endpoints needed by the settings page.


IMPORTANT: Before making any changes to the codebase, ALWAYS run `make install-pre-commit-hooks` to ensure pre-commit hooks are properly installed.

Before pushing any changes, you MUST ensure that any lint errors or simple test errors have been fixed.

* If you've made changes to the backend, you should run `pre-commit run --config ./dev_config/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml` (this will run on staged files).
* If you've made changes to the frontend, you should run `cd frontend && npm run lint:fix && npm run build ; cd ..`

The pre-commit hooks MUST pass successfully before pushing any changes to the repository. This is a mandatory requirement to maintain code quality and consistency.

If either command fails, it may have automatically fixed some issues. You should fix any issues that weren't automatically fixed,
then re-run the command to ensure it passes. Common issues include:
- Mypy type errors
- Ruff formatting issues
- Trailing whitespace
- Missing newlines at end of files

## Git Best Practices

- Prefer specific `git add <filename>` instead of `git add .` to avoid accidentally staging unintended files
- Be especially careful with `git reset --hard` after staging files, as it will remove accidentally staged files
- When remote has new changes, use `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/<branch>` on the same branch

## GitHub Actions

- Pin external third-party actions to a full 40-character commit SHA, with the version tag in a trailing comment (e.g. `uses: owner/repo@<sha> # v1.2.3`). Do not use mutable tags (`@v1`) or branches for third-party actions.
- GitHub-authored (`actions/*`, `github/*`) and first-party (`OpenHands/*`) actions are currently exempt.
- Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem bumps the pinned SHA and the trailing comment under the configured cooldown, so pinning does not block security or version updates.

## Lockfile Regeneration (Preserve Original Tool Versions)

When regenerating `uv.lock` you MUST use the same uv version that the repo pins, to avoid unnecessary diff noise.
The pinned version is the one in `containers/app/Dockerfile` (`ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:<version>`) and in the
`astral-sh/setup-uv` steps of the GitHub workflows; keep those two in sync when bumping uv.

```bash
UV_VERSION=$(grep -oE 'astral-sh/uv:[0-9.]+' containers/app/Dockerfile | cut -d: -f2)
uvx "uv@${UV_VERSION}" lock
```

This ensures that lockfile updates only contain actual dependency changes, not tool version migration artifacts.

## PR-Specific Artifacts (`.pr/` directory)

When working on a PR that requires design documents, scripts meant for development-only, or other temporary artifacts that should NOT be merged to main, store them in a `.pr/` directory at the repository root.

### Usage

```
.pr/
├── design.md       # Design decisions and architecture notes
├── analysis.md     # Investigation or debugging notes
├── logs/           # Test output or CI logs for reviewer reference
└── notes.md        # Any other PR-specific content
```

### How It Works

1. **Notification**: When `.pr/` exists, a comment is posted to the PR conversation alerting reviewers
2. **Auto-cleanup**: When the PR is approved, the `.pr/` directory is automatically removed via `.github/workflows/pr-artifacts.yml`
3. **Fork PRs**: Auto-cleanup cannot push to forks, so manual removal is required before merging

### Important Notes

- Do NOT put anything in `.pr/` that needs to be preserved after merge
- The `.pr/` check passes (green ✅) during development — it only posts a notification, not a blocking error
- For fork PRs: You must manually remove `.pr/` before the PR can be merged

### When to Use

- Complex refactoring that benefits from written design rationale
- Debugging sessions where you want to document your investigation
- E2E test results or logs that demonstrate a cross-repo feature works
- Feature implementations that need temporary planning docs
- Any analysis that helps reviewers understand the PR but isn't needed long-term

## Repository Structure
Backend:
- Located in the `openhands` directory
- The current V1 application server lives in `openhands/app_server/`. `make start-backend` still launches `openhands.server.listen:app`, which includes the V1 routes by default unless `ENABLE_V1=0`.
- For V1 web-app docs, LLM setup should point users to the Settings UI.
- Testing:
  - All tests are in `tests/unit/test_*.py`
  - To test new code, run `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_xxx.py` where `xxx` is the appropriate file for the current functionality
  - Write all tests with pytest
  - Tests for the SaaS/enterprise modules live in `tests/unit/server/`, `tests/unit/storage/`, `tests/unit/integrations/`, `tests/unit/sync/`, ...; `tests/unit/conftest.py` provides the PostgreSQL-backed DB fixtures they use


Frontend:
- Located in the `frontend` directory
- UI refactors: Budgets UI is split into `budgets.tsx` + `budgets-tabs.tsx`, `budgets-components.tsx`, `budgets-constants.ts`. Usage monitoring dashboard is split into `usage-dashboard.tsx` with `usage-dashboard-tabs.tsx`, `usage-dashboard-widgets.tsx`, and `usage-dashboard-utils.ts`. Shared inline SVGs live in `frontend/src/components/shared/icons/inline-icons.tsx`.

- Prerequisites: A recent version of NodeJS / NPM
- Setup: Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
- Testing:
  - Run tests: `npm run test`
  - To run specific tests: `npm run test -- -t "TestName"`
  - Our test framework is vitest
- Building:
  - Build for production: `npm run build`
- Environment Variables:
  - Set in `frontend/.env` or as environment variables
  - Available variables: VITE_BACKEND_HOST, VITE_USE_TLS, VITE_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY, VITE_FRONTEND_PORT
- Internationalization:
  - Generate i18n declaration file: `npm run make-i18n`
- Data Fetching & Cache Management:
  - We use TanStack Query (fka React Query) for data fetching and cache management
  - Data Access Layer: API client methods are located in `frontend/src/api` and should never be called directly from UI components - they must always be wrapped with TanStack Query
  - Custom hooks are located in `frontend/src/hooks/query/` and `frontend/src/hooks/mutation/`
  - Query hooks should follow the pattern use[Resource] (e.g., `useConversationSkills`)
  - Mutation hooks should follow the pattern use[Action] (e.g., `useDeleteConversation`)
  - Architecture rule: UI components → TanStack Query hooks → Data Access Layer (`frontend/src/api`) → API endpoints
  - For SaaS organization management screens, prefer deriving the selected organization from `useOrganizations()` plus the selected org ID store instead of adding a dedicated single-org fetch when only list-level fields (for example `name`) are needed.


## SaaS / Enterprise Modules

The SaaS/enterprise modules extend the OpenHands app server (`openhands/`). They live at the repository root, next to it:
- `server/` - the SaaS server: authentication and user management (Keycloak integration), org management, billing (Stripe), routes, services
- `storage/` - SQLAlchemy models and stores (PostgreSQL in production and in unit tests)
- `integrations/` - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Jira, Linear and Slack integrations
- `sync/` - CronJob entrypoints (`python -m sync.<job>`)
- `analytics/`, `utils/` - SaaS analytics user provider and shared helpers
- `migrations/` + `alembic.ini` - Alembic database migrations
- `saas_server.py` - the FastAPI app Kubernetes runs (`uvicorn saas_server:app`); `run_maintenance_tasks.py` / `run_budget_maintenance.py` - CronJob entrypoints; `run_budget_preflight.py` - upgrade preflight / post-upgrade gate hook entrypoint
- Email services: Resend remains in `server/services/email_service.py`; SMTPEmailService lives in
  `server/services/smtp_email_service.py` and is used for org invitations/budget alerts plus
  the SMTP-driven UI email-enabled checks (SMTP_HOST).
- Telemetry and analytics (PostHog, custom metrics framework)

### Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.12 or 3.13
- uv (for dependency management)
- Node.js 22.x (for frontend)
- Docker (optional)

**Setup Steps:**
1. Build the project: `make build` (runs `uv sync --all-groups`, installs the frontend and the pre-commit hooks)

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# Full unit test suite (app server + SaaS modules)
uv run pytest -n auto -s ./tests/unit --cov --cov-branch

# Test specific modules (faster for development)
uv run pytest tests/unit/server/routes/
uv run pytest tests/unit/storage/test_org_store.py

# Linting (IMPORTANT: use --show-diff-on-failure to match GitHub CI)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --config ./dev_config/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
```

**Running the SaaS Server:**
```bash
make start-saas-backend  # saas_server:app with hot reload (needs Postgres, Keycloak, ...; see dev_config/local_saas/README.md)
# or
make run-saas            # SaaS backend + frontend dev server
```

**Key Configuration Files:**
- `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock` - All Python dependencies (app server and SaaS modules)
- `Makefile` - Build and run commands
- `dev_config/python/` - Linting and type checking configuration
- `dev_config/local_saas/` - Helpers for running the SaaS server locally
- `migrations/` - Database migration files

**Database Migrations:**
The SaaS server uses Alembic for PostgreSQL-only database migrations. When making schema changes:
1. Create migration files in `migrations/versions/`
2. Test migrations with the PostgreSQL dialect or the PostgreSQL migration workflow (`uv run alembic upgrade head`)
3. The CI will check for migration conflicts on PRs

**Integration Development:**
The codebase includes integrations for:
- **GitHub** - PR management, webhooks, app installations
- **GitLab** - Similar to GitHub but for GitLab instances
- **Jira** - Issue tracking and project management
- **Linear** - Modern issue tracking
- **Slack** - Team communication and notifications

Each integration follows a consistent pattern with service classes, storage models, and API endpoints.

**Important Notes:**
- The code is licensed under Polyform Free Trial License (30-day limit)
- The SaaS server extends the OpenHands app server through dynamic imports (`OPENHANDS_CONFIG_CLS`, `OH_*_KIND` env vars name classes such as `server.config.SaaSServerConfig`)
- Database changes require careful migration planning in `migrations/`
- Always test changes against both the app server and the SaaS server

**Detecting "cloud (app.all-hands.dev) vs self-hosted" — ALWAYS use `DEPLOYMENT_MODE`, never `app_mode`:**
These two signals measure different axes and are NOT interchangeable. Mixing them up is a recurring bug source, so follow this rule exactly:

- Use `from server.constants import DEPLOYMENT_MODE` and branch on `DEPLOYMENT_MODE == 'cloud'` (self-hosted is `== 'self_hosted'`).
  - `'cloud'` == All-Hands-managed domains: `app.all-hands.dev`, `app.openhands.ai`, and any `*.all-hands.dev` / `*.openhands.ai` / `*.openhands.dev` (this includes staging/feature envs), unless overridden by `OH_DEPLOYMENT_MODE`. Defined in `server/constants.py` (`_get_deployment_mode`).
  - `'self_hosted'` == self-hosted enterprise installs.
- **Never** use `self.app_mode != 'saas'` (or `app_mode == AppMode.SAAS`) to distinguish cloud from self-hosted. `app_mode` (`openhands/app_server/config_api/config_models.py`, values `'oss'` / `'saas'`) only separates the pure OSS server (`OPENHANDS`) from the SaaS/enterprise server. Both `app.all-hands.dev` **and** self-hosted enterprise run the SaaS server, so `app_mode == 'saas'` is true for both — it cannot tell them apart.

| Deployment                        | `app_mode` | `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` |
|-----------------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| `app.all-hands.dev` (cloud SaaS)  | `saas`     | `cloud`            |
| Staging/feature envs              | `saas`     | `cloud`            |
| Self-hosted enterprise            | `saas`     | `self_hosted`      |
| Pure OSS                          | `oss`      | `self_hosted`      |

- Correct: `if DEPLOYMENT_MODE == 'cloud':` to gate code that must run only on the managed cloud (e.g. `app.all-hands.dev`).
- Wrong: `if self.app_mode != 'saas':` — this only excludes the OSS server; it will still run on self-hosted enterprise.
- Need production-only (exclude even staging)? Combine with a host check on `server.constants.HOST` (e.g. `HOST == 'app.all-hands.dev'`); `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` alone treats staging as `cloud`.

**The word "SaaS" is overloaded — disambiguate before coding:**
In everyday language a user saying "SaaS" / "in SaaS" / "SaaS-only" / "this is a SaaS bug" almost always means **the hosted cloud product (`app.all-hands.dev`)**, i.e. `DEPLOYMENT_MODE == 'cloud'`. But in this codebase the enum value `AppMode.SAAS` is the SaaS *server class* and is true for **both** `app.all-hands.dev` and self-hosted enterprise. These are not the same thing. So:
- Do NOT reach for `app_mode == 'saas'` / `self.app_mode != 'saas'` just because the request contains the word "saas".
- When a request says "SaaS" and is gating/scoping behavior (e.g. "only run this on SaaS", "hide this on SaaS", "fix this in SaaS"), assume the user likely means **cloud (`app.all-hands.dev`) = `DEPLOYMENT_MODE == 'cloud'`** — and if it's genuinely ambiguous whether they mean cloud-only vs. (cloud + self-hosted enterprise), **ask the user to clarify** before implementing, rather than silently picking `app_mode`.
- `app_mode == 'saas'` is the right signal only when the distinction is OSS-vs-not-OSS (pure OpenHands app server vs. the SaaS/enterprise server), never for cloud-vs-self-hosted.

**Testing Best Practices:**

**Database Testing:**
- Use the `engine` / `session_maker` / `async_engine` / `async_session_maker` fixtures from `tests/unit/conftest.py`
  for application unit tests. Each test gets its own PostgreSQL database, migrated to head, cloned from a template
  (see `tests/postgres_testdb.py`); never hand-roll a SQLite engine
- Do not add SQLite paths to Alembic migrations
- Create module-specific `conftest.py` files with database fixtures
- Mock external database connections in unit tests to avoid dependency on running services
- Use real database connections only for integration tests

**Import Patterns:**
- The SaaS modules are top-level packages: `from storage.database import a_session_maker`, `from server.auth ...`
- Strings that name classes or patch targets use the same top-level names, e.g. `patch('storage.database.session_maker')`, `OPENHANDS_CONFIG_CLS=server.config.SaaSServerConfig`

**Test Structure:**
- Place tests in `tests/unit/` following the same structure as the source code (`tests/unit/server/`, `tests/unit/storage/`, ...)
- Use `--confcutdir=tests/unit/[module]` when testing specific modules
- Create comprehensive fixtures for complex objects (databases, external services)
- Write platform-agnostic tests (avoid hardcoded OS-specific assertions)

**Mocking Strategy:**
- Use `AsyncMock` for async operations and `MagicMock` for complex objects
- Mock all external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems) in unit tests
- Use `patch` with correct import paths (e.g., `server.routes.billing.logger`)
- Test both success and failure scenarios with proper error handling

**Coverage Goals:**
- Aim for 90%+ test coverage on new modules
- Focus on critical business logic and error handling paths
- Use `--cov-report=term-missing` to identify uncovered lines

**Troubleshooting:**
- If tests fail, ensure all dependencies are installed: `uv sync --all-groups`
- For database issues, check migration status and run migrations if needed
- For frontend issues, ensure the frontend is built: `make build`
- Check logs in the `logs/` directory for runtime issues
- **If GitHub CI fails but local linting passes**: Always use `--show-diff-on-failure` flag to match CI behavior exactly

## Template for Github Pull Request

If you are starting a pull request (PR), please follow the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- The PR template now starts with a `HUMAN:` section, the human-tested checkbox, and an `AGENT:` section.
- `.github/workflows/pr-readiness-confirm.yml` checks non-draft PRs for non-empty text between `HUMAN:` and the human-tested checkbox; if present it adds a 👍 reaction, and if absent it posts a reminder comment.


## Implementation Details

These details may or may not be useful for your current task.

### Conversation State Management

#### Agent State and Sandbox Status:
The frontend uses `useAgentState` hook (`frontend/src/hooks/use-agent-state.ts`) to determine the current conversation state. This hook:
- Returns `curAgentState` (AgentState enum) for UI state determination
- Returns `isArchived` flag when `sandbox_status === "MISSING"` (archived conversations)
- Prioritizes live WebSocket execution status over cached API data

#### Archived Conversations (sandbox_status === "MISSING"):
When a conversation's sandbox is no longer available (archived):
- `useAgentState` returns `AgentState.STOPPED` and `isArchived: true`
- Chat input is replaced with an archived banner (`ArchivedBanner` component)
- VS Code tab, Terminal, and Planner show read-only messages instead of loading states
- All interactive elements that require a running sandbox are disabled

#### Testing useAgentState:
When mocking `useAgentState` in tests, always include the `isArchived` property:
```typescript
vi.mock("#/hooks/use-agent-state", () => ({
  useAgentState: () => ({
    curAgentState: AgentState.AWAITING_USER_INPUT,
    isArchived: false,
  }),
}));
```

### Microagents

Microagents are specialized prompts that enhance OpenHands with domain-specific knowledge and task-specific workflows. They are Markdown files that can include frontmatter for configuration.

#### Types:
- **Public Skills/Microagents**: Located in `skills/`, available to all users
- **Repository Microagents**: Located in `.openhands/microagents/`, specific to this repository

#### Loading Behavior:
- **Without frontmatter**: Always loaded into LLM context
- **With triggers in frontmatter**: Only loaded when user's message matches the specified trigger keywords

#### Structure:
```yaml
---
triggers:
- keyword1
- keyword2
---
# Microagent Content
Your specialized knowledge and instructions here...
```

### Frontend

#### Action Handling:
- Actions are defined in `frontend/src/types/action-type.tsx`
- The frontend uses Zustand stores (`frontend/src/stores/`) for state management, not Redux
- To add a new action type to the UI, update the relevant store (e.g., `conversation-store.ts`) and add a translation key in the format `ACTION_MESSAGE$ACTION_NAME` to the i18n files
- Actions with `thought` property are displayed in the UI based on their action type:
  - Regular actions (like "run", "edit") display the thought as a separate message
  - Special actions (like "think") are displayed as collapsible elements only

#### Adding User Settings:
- To add a new user setting to OpenHands, follow these steps:
  1. Add the setting to the frontend:
     - Add the setting to the `Settings` type in `frontend/src/types/settings.ts`
     - Add the setting with an appropriate default value to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `frontend/src/services/settings.ts`
     - Update the `useSettings` hook in `frontend/src/hooks/query/use-settings.ts` to map the API response
     - Update the `useSaveSettings` hook in `frontend/src/hooks/mutation/use-save-settings.ts` to include the setting in API requests
     - Add UI components (like toggle switches) in the appropriate settings screen (e.g., `frontend/src/routes/app-settings.tsx`)
     - Add i18n translations for the setting name and any tooltips in `frontend/src/i18n/translation.json`
     - Add the translation key to `frontend/src/i18n/declaration.ts`
  2. Add the setting to the backend:
     - Add the setting to the `Settings` model in `openhands/app_server/settings/settings_models.py`
     - Update any relevant backend code to apply the setting (e.g., in session creation)

#### Settings UI Patterns:

There are two main patterns for saving settings in the OpenHands frontend:

**Pattern 1: Entity-based Resources (Immediate Save)**
- Used for: API Keys, Secrets, MCP Servers
- Behavior: Changes are saved immediately when user performs actions (add/edit/delete)
- Implementation:
  - No "Save Changes" button
  - No local state management or `isDirty` tracking
  - Uses dedicated mutation hooks for each operation (e.g., `use-add-mcp-server.ts`, `use-delete-mcp-server.ts`)
  - Each mutation triggers immediate API call with query invalidation for UI updates
  - Example: MCP settings, API Keys & Secrets tabs
- Benefits: Simpler UX, no risk of losing changes, consistent with modern web app patterns

**Pattern 2: Form-based Settings (Manual Save)**
- Used for: Application settings, LLM configuration
- Behavior: Changes are accumulated locally and saved when user clicks "Save Changes"
- Implementation:
  - Has "Save Changes" button that becomes enabled when changes are detected
  - Uses local state management with `isDirty` tracking
  - Uses `useSaveSettings` hook to save all changes at once
  - Example: LLM tab, Application tab
- Benefits: Allows bulk changes, explicit save action, can validate all fields before saving

**When to use each pattern:**
- Use Pattern 1 (Immediate Save) for entity management where each item is independent
- Use Pattern 2 (Manual Save) for configuration forms where settings are interdependent or need validation
- Git provider tokens in the local/OSS integrations settings are managed through the V1 secrets endpoints (`POST`/`DELETE /api/v1/secrets/git-providers`). Do not reuse the logout flow for disconnecting tokens; `useLogout` is for actual app logout and still targets legacy OSS logout behavior.

### Adding New LLM Models

LLM model configuration in this repo lives in `openhands/app_server/utils/llm.py`. The
`get_openhands_models()` function returns the list of OpenHands-managed provider models
shown in the frontend model selector. The frontend groups and prioritizes models using the
`organizeModelsAndProviders` utility (`frontend/src/utils/organize-models-and-providers.ts`)
and the `extractModelAndProvider` utility (`frontend/src/utils/extract-model-and-provider.ts`).

Note: the arrays `VERIFIED_MODELS`, `VERIFIED_OPENAI_MODELS`, etc., and the files
`frontend/src/utils/verified-models.ts`, `openhands/cli/utils.py`, and `openhands/llm/llm.py`
referenced in older versions of this guide exist in the main OpenHands repo, not this one.

### Environment Variable Enable Toggles

When adding a new boolean enable toggle read from an environment variable (e.g. `FEATURE_ENABLED`, `SLACK_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED`), the check **must** accept both `'true'` and `'1'` as truthy values. Older Helm chart versions default to `'1'` rather than `'true'`, so accepting only one form silently disables the feature in those deployments.

**Required pattern:**
```python
os.getenv('MY_FEATURE_ENABLED', 'false').lower() in ('true', '1')
```

**Do not use:**
```python
os.getenv('MY_FEATURE_ENABLED', 'false').lower() == 'true'  # breaks when value is '1'
os.getenv('MY_FEATURE_ENABLED', 'false') == '1'             # breaks when value is 'true'
bool(os.getenv('MY_FEATURE_ENABLED'))                       # treats any non-empty string as True
```

This applies anywhere an env var gates a feature: backend config, web client config injectors, integration service initialization, etc. Add a unit test for the `'1'` case alongside the `'true'` case.

### Sandbox Settings API (SDK Credential Inheritance)

The sandbox settings API allows SDK-created conversations to inherit the user's SaaS credentials
(LLM config, secrets) securely via `LookupSecret`. Raw secret values only flow SaaS→sandbox,
never through the SDK client.

#### User Credentials with Exposed Secrets (in `openhands/app_server/user/user_router.py`):
- `GET /api/v1/users/me?expose_secrets=true` → Full user settings with unmasked secrets (e.g., `llm_api_key`)
- `GET /api/v1/users/me` → Full user settings (secrets masked, Bearer only)

Auth requirements for `expose_secrets=true`:
- Bearer token (proves user identity via `OPENHANDS_API_KEY`)
- `X-Session-API-Key` header (proves caller has an active sandbox owned by the authenticated user)

Called by `workspace.get_llm()` in the SDK to retrieve LLM config with the API key.

#### Sandbox-Scoped Secrets Endpoints (in `openhands/app_server/sandbox/sandbox_router.py`):
- `GET /sandboxes/{id}/settings/secrets` → list secret names (no values)
- `GET /sandboxes/{id}/settings/secrets/{name}` → raw secret value (called FROM sandbox)

#### Auth: `X-Session-API-Key` header, validated via `SandboxService.get_sandbox_by_session_api_key()`

#### Related SDK code (in `software-agent-sdk` repo):
- `openhands/sdk/llm/llm.py`: `LLM.api_key` accepts `SecretSource` (including `LookupSecret`)
- `openhands/workspace/cloud/workspace.py`: `get_llm()` and `get_secrets()` return LookupSecret-backed objects
- Tests: `tests/sdk/llm/test_llm_secret_source_api_key.py`, `tests/workspace/test_cloud_workspace_sdk_settings.py`

### Issue Triage Automation

- `.github/workflows/issue-opened.yml` has a second issue-opened job that auto-applies `good first issue` after the duplicate check completes.
- The duplicate check is used only as a veto/guardrail for `good first issue` automation: duplicate or overlapping-scope issues should not be auto-labeled.
- The OpenHands classifier logic for newcomer suitability lives in `scripts/issue_good_first_issue_check_openhands.py`, with focused unit coverage in `tests/unit/test_issue_good_first_issue_check_openhands.py`.
