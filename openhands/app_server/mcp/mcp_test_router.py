"""MCP connection-test route for the OpenHands App Server.

``POST /api/v1/mcp/test`` lets the settings UIs (bundled frontend and Agent
Canvas) verify a remote MCP server before or after saving it. It reuses the
agent-server's single-server probe so the response contract is identical to
the sandbox's ``POST /api/mcp/test``: HTTP 200 with ``ok=true`` and the tool
names, or ``ok=false`` with a coarse ``error_kind`` (``timeout`` /
``connection`` / ``unknown``).

Differences from the sandbox endpoint, by design:

- Only remote transports (``sse`` / ``http``) are probed. ``stdio`` servers run
  inside the sandbox and must never spawn a process on the app server.
- Redacted secrets (``**********``) submitted for an already-stored server are
  restored from the user's persisted settings — the same rules ``POST
  /api/v1/settings`` applies — so a test exercises exactly the credentials a
  save would persist, without the browser ever seeing them. Restored values are
  scrubbed from the response text.
- OAuth-authenticated servers are not probed here; ``mcp_oauth_router`` runs
  the browser-coordinated OAuth install flow for them.
- The probe originates from the app-server pod, not from a sandbox, so network
  reachability can differ between the two.

Threat model
------------
The probe makes the app-server pod open an outbound HTTP/SSE connection to a
user-supplied URL, which is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) surface. The
route therefore:

- accepts only ``http`` / ``https`` URLs;
- resolves the target host before probing and rejects addresses that are never
  a legitimate MCP host but are classic pivots from a pod: loopback (the pod's
  own sidecars), link-local (cloud instance-metadata services such as
  ``169.254.169.254``), unspecified, multicast and reserved ranges, including
  their IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms. RFC 1918 / ULA private ranges stay reachable on
  purpose: self-hosted deployments point at MCP servers on their internal
  network, the same hosts the sandbox connects to at conversation start;
- performs nothing beyond the MCP handshake and ``tools/list`` (plus an optional
  caller-chosen tool call) and never echoes response bodies: only the SDK's
  condensed error string, scrubbed of secrets, reaches the client;
- inherits the app-wide per-client request rate limit (``RateLimitMiddleware``).

Residual risk: the address check and the probe resolve DNS independently, so a
host whose answer changes between the two (DNS rebinding) can bypass the check.
Set ``MCP_TEST_ALLOW_LOCAL_TARGETS=true`` to disable the address check for local
development against MCP servers on localhost.
